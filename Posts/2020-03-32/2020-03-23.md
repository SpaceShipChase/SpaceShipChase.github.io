Today, I'm proud to be a part of IBM. IBM has set aside massive amounts of resources to help the U.S.
and other countries research and deal with the virus. 
[Check out this page.](https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/covid19/)


And IBM technology is at the forefront of research. [This article](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/nordic-msp/ibm-supercomputer-summit-attacks-coronavirus/) 
is about how the Oak Ridge National Lab is using the IBM built Summit super computer for virus research as well.


I'm also contributing to Folding@Home with my personal computers right now. The heat in my office is unreal
with the video cards running full blast around the clock, but it's worth it. 
Anybody can help and it is very easy to set up.](https://foldingathome.org/)
It probably won't hurt your power bill much and it's definitely a better cause than churning on the cryptocurrency du jour. 
In fact, I would like to see some of the large crypto communities pitch in...

Uuuugggghhhh... These things look so nerdy but they work so well...
